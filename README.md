# Password Generator

## Description:

This week's challenge required modifying starter code to create an application that enables the user to generate random passwords based on choices selected . To ensure the criteria for this challenge was met I created functions to set rules/limits that help guide the user. A for loop was also implemented to allow the user password to be random every time. Generated passwords were made up of a combination of upper and lowercase letter, numbers and special characters.
